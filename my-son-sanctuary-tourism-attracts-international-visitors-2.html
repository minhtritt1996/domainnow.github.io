Along with implementing effective pandemic prevention measures to ensure a safe destination, the site was opened to visitors whenever conditions allowed.</p><p>In particular, during the challenging period for tourism, the My Son Cultural Heritage Management Board focused on promoting the site to reach out to tourists. This included live-streamed presentations on social media platforms using digital technology.</p><p>Foreign tourists return to My Son after the pandemic.</p><p>The National Tourism Year 2022 in Quang Nam was an opportunity for My Son to attract visitors. Two programs, "Legendary Night at My Son" and "Apsara Legend," effectively promoted the image of the My Son Sanctuary to domestic and international tourists.</p><p>After the disruption of tourism due to the COVID-19 pandemic, from the second quarter of 2022, as tourism gradually recovered, the number of visitors to the My Son World Cultural Heritage Site began to grow again.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Du lịch Thánh địa Mỹ Sơn hút khách quốc tế - 3">By the end of 2022, the number of international visitors steadily increased, with group tours dominating.

"The Chinese market accounts for 25% of the share, so with China's reopening, we hope to welcome more international tourists to My Son this year," said Mr. Phan Ho.</p><p>In 2023, the My Son Sanctuary is expected to receive 180,000 visitors, including 130,000 international tourists and 50,000 domestic tourists.</p><p>Additionally, the My Son Cultural Heritage Management Board will focus on consolidating traditional markets such as Europe, Australia, and the United States, while preparing to welcome tourists from East Asia as these countries reopen. This is a high-demand market for entertainment, so efforts will concentrate on enhancing artistic programs.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on January 3, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://domainnow.one/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://domainnow.one/authors/tran-minh-tri/" rel="author">Tran Minh Tri</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://domainnow.one/my-son-sanctuary-tourism-attracts-international-visitors.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> My Son Sanctuary Tourism Attracts International Visitors</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://domainnow.one/my-son-sanctuary-tourism-attracts-international-visitors.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> My Son Sanctuary Tourism Attracts International Visitors</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="https://domainnow.one/authors/tran-minh-tri/" class="feed__author">Tran Minh Tri</a> <time datetime="2024-12-30T13:19" class="feed__date">December 30, 2024</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="https://domainnow.one/my-son-sanctuary-tourism-attracts-international-visitors.html">My Son Sanctuary Tourism Attracts International Visitors</a></h3></header><p>My Son Sanctuary Tourism Attracts International Visitors (Dân trí) – In 2022, the My Son Sanctuary welcomed nearly 67,000 international visitors, accounting for only 25% of the pre-pandemic figure (2019), but there are signs of recovery in international tourism.
