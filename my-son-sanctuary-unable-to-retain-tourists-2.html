However, despite its historical and cultural importance, the site has yet to fully capitalize on its potential to generate lasting benefits for the local community. Although the sanctuary is a beautiful and historically significant location, it struggles to retain visitors for extended periods due to the lack of additional services and attractions that could enhance the overall tourist experience.</p><p>Tourists, particularly those from Europe, Japan, and India, who make up a significant portion of visitors, have expressed their disappointment regarding the lack of local products, shopping options, and cultural experiences beyond the temple complex itself. The visitors often leave the site shortly after their temple tour, as there are few opportunities for them to engage more deeply with the region’s culture or enjoy leisure activities.</p><p>The sanctuary is visually striking, surrounded by lush nature and mountains, and the temple complex itself remains relatively well-preserved. However, the overall tourist experience is monotonous and does not include activities or services that might encourage guests to stay longer. Visitors are typically transported by electric vehicles from the entrance to the temple complex, where they explore the site on foot. The journey usually lasts less than an hour, leaving little to stimulate further exploration or encourage tourists to spend more time or money in the area.</p><p>Despite the rising number of visitors, the local community has not seen significant benefits from the influx of tourists. The site remains a "stopover" rather than a fully developed destination. The surrounding community has not been effectively integrated into the tourism ecosystem, meaning that many local residents do not benefit from tourism-related services. There are very few businesses offering the kinds of services that could enhance a tourist's visit, such as shopping or cultural experiences. As a result, tourists often return to nearby cities like Hội An or Da Nang, where the tourism infrastructure is more developed.</p><p>There have been some initiatives to address this issue, such as the establishment of a community tourism village in 2013, which was supported by the International Labour Organization (ILO). The village was intended to offer accommodation and other services, managed by local families. However, this project has largely failed, with low occupancy rates and many of the lodgings remaining closed. The residents, who were initially encouraged to shift from farming to tourism-related activities, still struggle to benefit economically from their proximity to the sanctuary.</p><p>Additionally, there is only one hotel near the sanctuary, which has struggled to attract guests despite significant investment. This lack of services around the sanctuary, such as cultural attractions, local products, and diverse dining options, has limited the potential for tourism to create a sustainable economic benefit for the surrounding community.</p><p>In contrast to other heritage sites like Hội An, which have successfully created a thriving tourism ecosystem that benefits local businesses and provides a wide range of services for visitors, Mỹ Sơn remains underdeveloped in terms of tourist infrastructure. While it continues to attract significant numbers of visitors, without more comprehensive development and the creation of a broader tourism ecosystem, Mỹ Sơn is unlikely to reach its full potential as a key tourism destination.</p></div><aside class="content__aside"><div class="content__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on January 3, 2025</div><div class="content__share"></div></aside><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__bio box"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://domainnow.one/authors/tran-minh-tri/" title="Tran Minh Tri">Tran Minh Tri</a></h4></div></div><nav class="content__nav box"><div class="content__nav__prev"><a href="https://domainnow.one/my-son-sanctuary-unable-to-retain-tourists.html" class="content__nav__link" rel="prev"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>My Son Sanctuary: Unable to retain tourists</h5></div></a></div><div class="content__nav__next"><a href="https://domainnow.one/my-son-sanctuary-unable-to-retain-tourists.html" class="content__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>My Son Sanctuary: Unable to retain tourists</h5></div></a></div></nav><div class="content__related box"><h3 class="box__title">Related posts</h3><div class="content__related-wrap"><figure class="content__related-item"><figcaption><h4 class="content__related-title"><a href="https://domainnow.one/my-son-sanctuary-explore-the-1600-year-old-ruins-of-the-champa-kingdom-2.html" class="inverse">My Son Sanctuary: Explore the 1600-year-old ruins of the Champa Kingdom</a></h4><time datetime="2024-12-30T13:12" class="u-small">December 30, 2024</time></figcaption></figure><figure class="content__related-item"><figcaption><h4 class="content__related-title"><a href="https://domainnow.one/tourists-visiting-my-son-sanctuary-increase-more-than-threefold-2.html" class="inverse">Tourists Visiting Mỹ Sơn Sanctuary Increase More Than Threefold</a></h4><time datetime="2024-12-30T12:57" class="u-small">December 30, 2024</time></figcaption></figure><figure class="content__related-item"><figcaption><h4 class="content__related-title"><a href="https://domainnow.one/my-son-sanctuary-explore-the-1600-year-old-ruins-of-the-champa-kingdom.html" class="inverse">My Son Sanctuary: Explore the 1600-year-old ruins of the Champa Kingdom</a></h4><time datetime="2024-12-30T13:12" class="u-small">December 30, 2024</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box authors"><h3 class="box__title">Authors</h3><ul class="authors__cotainer"><li class="authors__item"><div><a href="https://domainnow.one/authors/tran-minh-tri/" class="authors__title">Tran Minh Tri</a> <span class="u-small">Post: 20</span></div></li></ul></section><section class="newsletter box box--gray"><h3 class="box__title">Newsletter</h3><p class="newsletter__description">Sign up to receive email updates and to hear what's going on with us!</p><form>...</form></section></div><footer class="footer"><a class="footer__logo" href="https://domainnow.one/">domainnow.one</a><nav><ul class="footer__nav"></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
