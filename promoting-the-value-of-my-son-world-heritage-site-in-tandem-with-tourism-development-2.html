(Photo: TH/Vietnam+)</p><p>The My Son Sanctuary, located in Duy Phu commune, Duy Xuyen district, Quang Nam province, is the most famous architectural complex of the Cham people in Vietnam, attracting a large number of domestic and international tourists.</p><h3>The Cham Pa Legacy in the Heart of Quang</h3><p>The My Son Sanctuary was built from the late 4th century to the 13th century. In 1898, a Frenchman named M.C. Paris discovered the My Son temple complex hidden in a narrow valley amid dense forests.</p><p>Not long after, scientists from the French School of the Far East studied the inscriptions and architectural and sculptural works at My Son.</p><p>These researchers unveiled the mystery of My Son, revealing it as the most magnificent and quintessential religious site of the Cham people, continuously constructed over more than 1,000 years.</p><p>Initiated in the 4th century by King Bhadravarman (reigned from 349 to 361) and completed in the late 13th or early 14th century under King Jaya Simhavarman III (Che Man), My Son comprises over 70 temples and towers, reflecting various architectural and sculptural styles of different historical periods of the Cham kingdom.</p><p>Most architectural works and sculptures at My Son are influenced by Hinduism.</p><p>The temples and towers mainly face east, the direction of the rising sun and the abode of deities. However, some towers face west or both east and west, symbolizing the belief in the afterlife of the kings who were deified after their deaths to honor their ancestors.</p><h3>[Video] My Son Sanctuary: The Cham Pa Legacy in the Heart of Quang</h3><p>Damaged by war, My Son had only 32 remaining structures by 1975, of which about 20 retained their original form. Unfortunately, the largest structure, Tower A1, which stood 24 meters high and had six auxiliary towers, was considered a masterpiece of Cham architecture but was destroyed by U.S. bombs in late 1969.</p><p>Despite many temples and towers being reduced to ruins, My Son remains a unique cultural, artistic, and architectural heritage of humanity.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://domainnow.one/media/posts/20/ditich_myson_03.jpg" alt="Phát huy giá trị Di sản Thế giới Mỹ Sơn gắn với phát triển du lịch ảnh 2" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://domainnow.one/media/posts/20/responsive/ditich_myson_03-xs.jpg 300w, https://domainnow.one/media/posts/20/responsive/ditich_myson_03-sm.jpg 480w, https://domainnow.one/media/posts/20/responsive/ditich_myson_03-md.jpg 768w, https://domainnow.one/media/posts/20/responsive/ditich_myson_03-lg.jpg 1024w, https://domainnow.one/media/posts/20/responsive/ditich_myson_03-xl.jpg 1360w, https://domainnow.one/media/posts/20/responsive/ditich_myson_03-2xl.jpg 1600w"></p><p>The main temples in My Son are dedicated to a Linga or depictions of the deity Shiva—the protector of Cham royal lineages. The god worshipped at My Son is Bhadravarman, who founded the first ruling dynasty of the Amaravati region in the 4th century, combined with Shiva’s name, forming the primary deity-king and royal ancestor worship tradition.</p><p>On April 29, 1979, the Ministry of Culture and Information issued Decision No. 54VH/QĐ recognizing My Son as an Architectural and Artistic Monument.</p><p>On December 1, 1999, the UNESCO World Heritage Committee officially recognized My Son Sanctuary as a World Cultural Heritage.</p><h3>Promoting Heritage Value Linked to Sustainable Tourism Development</h3><p>Despite the ups and downs of history, My Son remains a unique cultural, artistic, and architectural treasure of humanity, embodying the intellect and talent of many generations.</p><p>Preserving and promoting the value of My Son World Cultural Heritage in conjunction with sustainable tourism development, ensuring harmony between cultural and economic development, and applying modern science and technology in conservation efforts while strictly adhering to regulations on state management, World Heritage conservation conventions, and the Cultural Heritage Law are the guiding principles currently implemented by Duy Xuyen district, Quang Nam province.</p><p>According to Phan Ho, Director of the My Son World Cultural Heritage Management Board, significant progress has been made in the management and conservation of My Son over the more than 20 years since its recognition.</p><p>The site has collaborated with organizations and individuals both domestically and internationally, such as UNESCO, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the Lerici Foundation (Italy), the University of Milan, UNESCO Hanoi Office, the ASI Institute (India), the Institute of Monuments Restoration, the Archaeological Institute, the Department of Heritage, the Department of Culture, Sports and Tourism, and the Quang Nam Center for Heritage Conservation, to restore and enhance the B, C, D, G, K, H, and A tower groups. The remaining groups remain in ruin and have yet to be restored.</p><p>The My Son World Cultural Heritage Management Board is implementing new services and products to attract visitors to the site.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://domainnow.one/media/posts/20/Khuditich_Myson_01.jpg" alt="Phát huy giá trị Di sản Thế giới Mỹ Sơn gắn với phát triển du lịch ảnh 3" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://domainnow.one/media/posts/20/responsive/Khuditich_Myson_01-xs.jpg 300w, https://domainnow.one/media/posts/20/responsive/Khuditich_Myson_01-sm.jpg 480w, https://domainnow.one/media/posts/20/responsive/Khuditich_Myson_01-md.jpg 768w, https://domainnow.one/media/posts/20/responsive/Khuditich_Myson_01-lg.jpg 1024w, https://domainnow.one/media/posts/20/responsive/Khuditich_Myson_01-xl.jpg 1360w, https://domainnow.one/media/posts/20/responsive/Khuditich_Myson_01-2xl.jpg 1600w"></p><p>From now until 2030, besides the current offerings at the temple complex, the Management Board plans to develop tourism products in the buffer and core zones, including heritage cultural tourism and ecological tourism in the scenic forest area, spanning 1,158 hectares under their management.</p><p>The focus will be on developing eco-resort tourism in the buffer zone, centered around Thach Ban Lake and the surrounding primeval forest, positioning My Son as an appealing resort destination.</p><p>Starting in 2023, alongside ongoing restoration efforts, the Management Board will strengthen connectivity with destinations along the Central Heritage Journey and major tourism hubs; develop eco-friendly electric vehicle services aligned with modern tourism trends; and improve the quality of human resources, particularly interpreters, to educate visitors on the heritage's value.</p><p>New offerings include renting Cham costumes for photography combined with souvenir production, enhancing image promotion, and advancing research and global promotion of the My Son temple complex's heritage value.</p></div><aside class="content__aside"><div class="content__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on January 3, 2025</div><div class="content__share"></div></aside><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__bio box"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://domainnow.one/authors/tran-minh-tri/" title="Tran Minh Tri">Tran Minh Tri</a></h4></div></div><nav class="content__nav box"><div class="content__nav__prev"><a href="https://domainnow.one/promoting-the-value-of-my-son-world-heritage-site-in-tandem-with-tourism-development.html" class="content__nav__link" rel="prev"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>Promoting the Value of My Son World Heritage Site in Tandem with Tourism Development</h5></div></a></div><div class="content__nav__next"><a href="https://domainnow.one/promoting-the-value-of-my-son-world-heritage-site-in-tandem-with-tourism-development.html" class="content__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>Promoting the Value of My Son World Heritage Site in Tandem with Tourism Development</h5></div></a></div></nav><div class="content__related box"><h3 class="box__title">Related posts</h3><div class="content__related-wrap"><figure class="content__related-item"><figcaption><h4 class="content__related-title"><a href="https://domainnow.one/my-son-sanctuary-tourism-attracts-international-visitors-2.html" class="inverse">My Son Sanctuary Tourism Attracts International Visitors</a></h4><time datetime="2024-12-30T13:19" class="u-small">December 30, 2024</time></figcaption></figure><figure class="content__related-item"><figcaption><h4 class="content__related-title"><a href="https://domainnow.one/discovering-the-global-value-of-my-son-sanctuary-2.html" class="inverse">Discovering the Global Value of Mỹ Sơn Sanctuary</a></h4><time datetime="2024-12-30T12:55" class="u-small">December 30, 2024</time></figcaption></figure><figure class="content__related-item"><figcaption><h4 class="content__related-title"><a href="https://domainnow.one/my-son-sanctuary-tourism-attracts-international-visitors.html" class="inverse">My Son Sanctuary Tourism Attracts International Visitors</a></h4><time datetime="2024-12-30T13:19" class="u-small">December 30, 2024</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box authors"><h3 class="box__title">Authors</h3><ul class="authors__cotainer"><li class="authors__item"><div><a href="https://domainnow.one/authors/tran-minh-tri/" class="authors__title">Tran Minh Tri</a> <span class="u-small">Post: 20</span></div></li></ul></section><section class="newsletter box box--gray"><h3 class="box__title">Newsletter</h3><p class="newsletter__description">Sign up to receive email updates and to hear what's going on with us!</p><form>...</form></section></div><footer class="footer"><a class="footer__logo" href="https://domainnow.one/">domainnow.one</a><nav><ul class="footer__nav"></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
