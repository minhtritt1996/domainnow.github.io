<strong><em>About Da Nang city</em></strong>

My second home is Da Nang, and I adore showing it to my friends who live abroad. This tour aims to fully immerse you in Central Vietnamese <strong><em>sightseeing and cuisine</em></strong>, which has a distinctive culinary tradition that stimulates all five senses at affordable costs for locals and is produced with pride at market food stalls, along with my country’s culture, history, and beliefs.

With my experienced driver, we will go for a whole 4 hours on a private guided trip to some well-known locations. We frequently stop at rest areas to change.

<em><strong>Itinerary for the tour</strong></em>

You will get picked up by our tourguide at your hotel lobby

The daily tour will start with a typical drip coffee before passing My Khe beach, which <strong>Forbes magazine</strong> named one of the “<em><strong>top-10</strong></em>” beaches in the world.
<div class=""wp-container-1 wp-block-group""></div>
The 18th-century pagoda of Ling Ung on the <strong><em>Son Tra peninsular</em></strong>, where you’ll get breath-taking views of Da Nang and its beaches, is one of our most revered places of worship. Along with tourists from other nations, you will undoubtedly come across groups of rural Vietnamese people visiting the pagoda. You can awe with them at the enormous 67-meter-tall “Lady Buddha” statue as she surveys the East Sea and the distant Cham Islands.

On our way back to the city, we sample four additional regional specialties: the typical Vietnamese baguette, the renowned pancakes of Vietnam, the BBQ pig skewers, and the charcoal-grilled pork noodles.

The <strong><em>Marble Mountains</em></strong>, a magnificent collection of five limestone and marble hills that is a well-known pilgrimage site with peaks, caves, tunnels, and temples, is the next destination on our route. Anywhere you go in and around Da Nang, it’s hard to avoid encountering reminders of the Vietnam War or avoiding conversations about its effects. In 1965, the US Marine Corps landed at Red Beach 2, which is just north of Da Nang, and our international airport was once the sizable Da Nang US airbase. <strong><em>My Khe Beach</em></strong> was a place for relaxation. Please remember to question me about Marble Mountains’ use throughout the war as it was not immune to the consequences of the fighting.

The biggest wholesale and retail location in central Vietnam is <strong><em>Con Market</em></strong>, which we then visit. This location provides a wealth of information about Vietnamese daily living. Feel free to browse the store; if you need assistance, I will be nearby.

<strong><em>About Ba Na hill stations</em></strong>

Ba Na was founded in 1919 as a hill resort for the colonial French to escape the summer heat of Central Vietnam’s coast. Beginning in 1998, Ba Na was rebuilt from the ruins of the original as an eco resort and fantasy theme park. It is still evolving today, and for the many years since 2009, Ba Na Hills has been named “<em><strong>Vietnam Disneyland in Asia Version</strong>”</em>

The mountain <strong><em>‘Sun World Ba Na Hills’</em></strong> is located in the Truong Son mountain range, 36 kilometers west of Da Nang’s center and 65 kilometers from Hoi An. In good weather, it is 1487m above sea level and provides refreshingly cool weather as well as stunning views. This is your wonderful chance to get away from Da Nang or Hoi An.

<strong><em>Itinerary for the Ba na hills tour</em></strong>

<em>Note: The tour would be better if we start this tour early morning to avoid crowd and heat.</em>

To make the most of your special day, we will meet you in the lobby of your hotel in Hoi An or Da Nang for your Private Ba Na Hills Tour, driving straight to the Hoi An cable car station in our modern air conditioned vehicle. You’ll enjoy a breathtaking 15-minute ride above spectacular jungle and waterfalls on one of the world’s longest cable car systems, which spans approximately 5.8 kilometers. Bring comfortable walking shoes and an extra layer of clothing; when it’s 37 degrees in Da Nang, it can be 15-20 degrees on the mountain!

Fantasy Park has numerous facilities for children of all ages. In addition to 90 free games, you can walk through Fairy Forest, explore Dinosaur Park, and conquer the heights with a 29m Free-Fall tower, as well as modern 3D, 4D, and 5D movie systems.

Adults without children can easily spend a half-day exploring Ba Na Hill Resort with one of my teammates, while families are often content to spend the entire day enjoying its many child-friendly attractions. And because this is a Private Tour, you will have our undivided attention throughout the day, allowing you to see and experience everything the resort has to offer without wasting time. Of course, we make certain that you are safely returned to your hotel.",,2023-09-12,product,https://hoianvillagetours.com/tours/da-nang-ba-na-hills-golden-hand-bridge/,0,,950000,950000,,instock,,,0,simple,,,,https://hoianvillagetours.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/3F284B1B-550D-4D39-94F8-152C9AFC1077.jpeg|https://hoianvillagetours.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/E5D79541-C87A-4A20-AB9A-8C35BBD9CF2F-1024x413-1.jpeg|https://hoianvillagetours.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/653EF047-5ED0-49F9-BEEF-73CF5100DF2C-1024x569-1.jpeg|https://hoianvillagetours.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/B7C80EBA-2706-42A0-9AE7-391FF00EA1CC.jpeg|https://hoianvillagetours.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/269BC0EF-9FD6-4FD4-93A4-1B1C2E9D92F6-1024x682-1.jpeg|https://hoianvillagetours.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/5E16661A-AE32-4760-8550-C69BCF65A5E1-683x1024-1.jpeg|https://hoianvillagetours.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2E9F72C2-B5E3-41EC-AB92-EED06A075247-1024x774-1.jpeg,3F284B1B-550D-4D39-94F8-152C9AFC1077|E5D79541-C87A-4A20-AB9A-8C35BBD9CF2F-1024x413|653EF047-5ED0-49F9-BEEF-73CF5100DF2C-1024x569|B7C80EBA-2706-42A0-9AE7-391FF00EA1CC|269BC0EF-9FD6-4FD4-93A4-1B1C2E9D92F6-1024x682|5E16661A-AE32-4760-8550-C69BCF65A5E1-683x1024|2E9F72C2-B5E3-41EC-AB92-EED06A075247-1024x774,||||||,||||||,||||||,https://hoianvillagetours.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/3F284B1B-550D-4D39-94F8-152C9AFC1077.jpeg,,"Private Tours",publish,1,admin,fivetechmarketing@gmail.com,,,da-nang-ba-na-hills-golden-hand-bridge,,,0,0,open,closed,2023-09-12,no,no,,no,,,,,,,no,no,,,,,'-1,'-1,,,no,taxable,standard,"756,757,758,759,761,763",,8.0.3,,,0,0,

<strong><em>About the Hoi An</em></strong>

Hello, lovely Hoi An! If you enjoy picturesque streets, air scented with spices and incense, riverfront life with lanterns, and a healthy dose of tradition and culture, this is the spot for you. Sure, it’s touristic, and the old town is mostly packed with stores selling fridge magnets, windchimes, coconut shell bowls, and coffee, but it still has a lot of character. There’s a lively market (best viewed in the morning) where local life goes on despite visitors snapping photos of the ladies sitting in the middle of mounds of green herbs and fresh vegetables wearing their distinctive nón lá conical hats. And, as tourism has grown, so has the number of smart bars serving craft beer and sophisticated cocktails.

Today, there are many young people who enjoy eating organic foods and caring about animals, thus the demand for vegetarian cuisine is progressively growing around the world, including Vietnamese. If you are not a Buddhist, this may give you the impression that in Mahayana Buddhist nations such as Vietnam and China, there are days in the month when all Buddhists remain vegetarian and refuse all types of animal products. This helps you avoid producing samsaric karma and also adds to the body’s recuperation after ingesting animal flesh for several days. Vegetarianism has long been a tradition of the residents of Hoi An, a town with a strong religious heritage.

What makes this tour unique is that we blend many different cuisines in various locations to provide you with a genuinely unforgettable experience while listening to stories from the welcoming people of Hoi An

Another aspect contributing to the popularity of this tour is that Hoi An boasts a plethora of delicious meals ideal for both local and foreign travelers, such as banh mi (Vietnamese sandwich), banh xeo (Vietnamese pancake), hot pot, spring rolls, and banh beo… The sweet sweets typical in Hoi An will be one of the most memorable and enjoyable experiences with a local guide.
