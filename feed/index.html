										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My Son Sanctuary Tourism Attracts International Visitors</p>
<p>(Dân trí) – In 2022, the My Son Sanctuary welcomed nearly 67,000 international visitors, accounting for only 25% of the pre-pandemic figure (2019), but there are signs of recovery in international tourism.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Phan Ho, Head of the My Son Cultural Heritage Management Board (Duy Xuyen District, Quang Nam Province), the two years of the pandemic severely impacted the number of visitors to the My Son Cultural Heritage Site.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Legendary Night at My Son&#8221; program, held at the site, attracted visitors for nighttime tours.</p>
<p><img alt="Du lịch Thánh địa Mỹ Sơn hút khách quốc tế - 2" /></p>
<p>Despite the prolonged pandemic, efforts were made to attract visitors, including devising strategies to welcome them back when the situation eased. Along with implementing effective pandemic prevention measures to ensure a safe destination, the site was opened to visitors whenever conditions allowed.</p>
<p>In particular, during the challenging period for tourism, the My Son Cultural Heritage Management Board focused on promoting the site to reach out to tourists. This included live-streamed presentations on social media platforms using digital technology.</p>
<p>Foreign tourists return to My Son after the pandemic.</p>
<p>The National Tourism Year 2022 in Quang Nam was an opportunity for My Son to attract visitors. Two programs, &#8220;Legendary Night at My Son&#8221; and &#8220;Apsara Legend,&#8221; effectively promoted the image of the My Son Sanctuary to domestic and international tourists.</p>
<p>After the disruption of tourism due to the COVID-19 pandemic, from the second quarter of 2022, as tourism gradually recovered, the number of visitors to the My Son World Cultural Heritage Site began to grow again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img alt="Du lịch Thánh địa Mỹ Sơn hút khách quốc tế - 3" />By the end of 2022, the number of international visitors steadily increased, with group tours dominating. Notably, the Indian tourist market showed significant growth.</p>
<p>Throughout 2022, the My Son Sanctuary welcomed over 100,000 visitors, including nearly 60,000 international tourists and more than 40,000 domestic visitors, generating revenue of over VND 16.7 billion.</p>
<p>The Apsara dance performed at My Son.</p>
<p>Mr. Phan Ho stated that in 2023, the prospects for visitors to My Son are brighter than in 2022 due to China&#8217;s reopening, which will bring back Chinese tourists. &#8220;The Chinese market accounts for 25% of the share, so with China&#8217;s reopening, we hope to welcome more international tourists to My Son this year,&#8221; said Mr. Phan Ho.</p>
<p>In 2023, the My Son Sanctuary is expected to receive 180,000 visitors, including 130,000 international tourists and 50,000 domestic tourists.</p>
<p>Additionally, the My Son Cultural Heritage Management Board will focus on consolidating traditional markets such as Europe, Australia, and the United States, while preparing to welcome tourists from East Asia as these countries reopen. This is a high-demand market for entertainment, so efforts will concentrate on enhancing artistic programs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Promoting the Value of My Son World Heritage Site in Tandem with Tourism Development</strong></p>
<p>The serene beauty of ancient Cham towers in the My Son World Cultural Heritage. (Photo: TH/Vietnam+)</p>
<p>The My Son Sanctuary, located in Duy Phu commune, Duy Xuyen district, Quang Nam province, is the most famous architectural complex of the Cham people in Vietnam, attracting a large number of domestic and international tourists.</p>
<h3>The Cham Pa Legacy in the Heart of Quang</h3>
<p>The My Son Sanctuary was built from the late 4th century to the 13th century. In 1898, a Frenchman named M.C. Paris discovered the My Son temple complex hidden in a narrow valley amid dense forests.</p>
<p>Not long after, scientists from the French School of the Far East studied the inscriptions and architectural and sculptural works at My Son.</p>
<p>These researchers unveiled the mystery of My Son, revealing it as the most magnificent and quintessential religious site of the Cham people, continuously constructed over more than 1,000 years.</p>
<p>Initiated in the 4th century by King Bhadravarman (reigned from 349 to 361) and completed in the late 13th or early 14th century under King Jaya Simhavarman III (Che Man), My Son comprises over 70 temples and towers, reflecting various architectural and sculptural styles of different historical periods of the Cham kingdom.</p>
<p>Most architectural works and sculptures at My Son are influenced by Hinduism.</p>
<p>The temples and towers mainly face east, the direction of the rising sun and the abode of deities. However, some towers face west or both east and west, symbolizing the belief in the afterlife of the kings who were deified after their deaths to honor their ancestors.</p>
<h3>[Video] My Son Sanctuary: The Cham Pa Legacy in the Heart of Quang</h3>
<p>Damaged by war, My Son had only 32 remaining structures by 1975, of which about 20 retained their original form. Unfortunately, the largest structure, Tower A1, which stood 24 meters high and had six auxiliary towers, was considered a masterpiece of Cham architecture but was destroyed by U.S. bombs in late 1969.</p>
<p>Despite many temples and towers being reduced to ruins, My Son remains a unique cultural, artistic, and architectural heritage of humanity.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://domainnow.one/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ditich_myson_03.jpg" alt="Phát huy giá trị Di sản Thế giới Mỹ Sơn gắn với phát triển du lịch ảnh 2" /></p>
<p>The main temples in My Son are dedicated to a Linga or depictions of the deity Shiva—the protector of Cham royal lineages. The god worshipped at My Son is Bhadravarman, who founded the first ruling dynasty of the Amaravati region in the 4th century, combined with Shiva’s name, forming the primary deity-king and royal ancestor worship tradition.</p>
<p>On April 29, 1979, the Ministry of Culture and Information issued Decision No. 54VH/QĐ recognizing My Son as an Architectural and Artistic Monument.</p>
<p>On December 1, 1999, the UNESCO World Heritage Committee officially recognized My Son Sanctuary as a World Cultural Heritage.</p>
<h3>Promoting Heritage Value Linked to Sustainable Tourism Development</h3>
<p>Despite the ups and downs of history, My Son remains a unique cultural, artistic, and architectural treasure of humanity, embodying the intellect and talent of many generations.</p>
<p>Preserving and promoting the value of My Son World Cultural Heritage in conjunction with sustainable tourism development, ensuring harmony between cultural and economic development, and applying modern science and technology in conservation efforts while strictly adhering to regulations on state management, World Heritage conservation conventions, and the Cultural Heritage Law are the guiding principles currently implemented by Duy Xuyen district, Quang Nam province.</p>
<p>According to Phan Ho, Director of the My Son World Cultural Heritage Management Board, significant progress has been made in the management and conservation of My Son over the more than 20 years since its recognition.</p>
<p>The site has collaborated with organizations and individuals both domestically and internationally, such as UNESCO, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the Lerici Foundation (Italy), the University of Milan, UNESCO Hanoi Office, the ASI Institute (India), the Institute of Monuments Restoration, the Archaeological Institute, the Department of Heritage, the Department of Culture, Sports and Tourism, and the Quang Nam Center for Heritage Conservation, to restore and enhance the B, C, D, G, K, H, and A tower groups. The remaining groups remain in ruin and have yet to be restored.</p>
<p>The My Son World Cultural Heritage Management Board is implementing new services and products to attract visitors to the site.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://domainnow.one/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Khuditich_Myson_01.jpg" alt="Phát huy giá trị Di sản Thế giới Mỹ Sơn gắn với phát triển du lịch ảnh 3" /></p>
<p>From now until 2030, besides the current offerings at the temple complex, the Management Board plans to develop tourism products in the buffer and core zones, including heritage cultural tourism and ecological tourism in the scenic forest area, spanning 1,158 hectares under their management.</p>
<p>The focus will be on developing eco-resort tourism in the buffer zone, centered around Thach Ban Lake and the surrounding primeval forest, positioning My Son as an appealing resort destination.</p>
<p>Starting in 2023, alongside ongoing restoration efforts, the Management Board will strengthen connectivity with destinations along the Central Heritage Journey and major tourism hubs; develop eco-friendly electric vehicle services aligned with modern tourism trends; and improve the quality of human resources, particularly interpreters, to educate visitors on the heritage&#8217;s value.</p>
<p>New offerings include renting Cham costumes for photography combined with souvenir production, enhancing image promotion, and advancing research and global promotion of the My Son temple complex&#8217;s heritage value.</p>

<p>My Son Sanctuary was built between the 4th and 13th centuries CE by the Cham people, a culture that developed along the coast of modern Vietnam and had spiritual origins in Indian Hinduism. The impressive tower temples at My Son served as the political and religious capital of the Champa Kingdom. The stone stele of the Cham royal dynasties confirms My Son&#8217;s importance as the sacred heart of the Cham people during those centuries.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" src="https://domainnow.one/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/my-son-sanctuary-8_1692069894.jpg" alt="My Son Sanctuary" /></p>
<p>The sanctuary spans 1158 hectares. It takes about 2 to 3 hours to explore its most notable features.</p>
<h4>3.1. Ancient Cham Architecture of My Son Sanctuary</h4>
<p>The most captivating aspect of My Son Sanctuary is its unique Cham architecture, heavily influenced by Indian styles. The Cham towers were built on quadrilateral foundations, and each tower has three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A sturdy foundation representing the mortal world.</li>
<li>A sacred body symbolizing the spiritual world.</li>
<li>The tower top, shaped like a man offering flowers, birds, or animals, representing the connection between spirits and humans.</li>
</ul>
<p>Though many structures have been damaged, the remaining towers and sculptures offer a glimpse into the rich cultural heritage of the Cham people.</p>
<h4>3.2. My Son Sanctuary Museum</h4>

The festival features vibrant traditional costumes, passionate dances, and symphonic music, creating a surreal cultural experience.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Mỹ Sơn Sanctuary, recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site for 20 years, has experienced a significant increase in visitor numbers, reaching 420,000 annually. However, despite its historical and cultural importance, the site has yet to fully capitalize on its potential to generate lasting benefits for the local community. Although the sanctuary is a beautiful and historically significant location, it struggles to retain visitors for extended periods due to the lack of additional services and attractions that could enhance the overall tourist experience.</p>
<p>Tourists, particularly those from Europe, Japan, and India, who make up a significant portion of visitors, have expressed their disappointment regarding the lack of local products, shopping options, and cultural experiences beyond the temple complex itself. The visitors often leave the site shortly after their temple tour, as there are few opportunities for them to engage more deeply with the region’s culture or enjoy leisure activities.</p>
<p>The sanctuary is visually striking, surrounded by lush nature and mountains, and the temple complex itself remains relatively well-preserved. However, the overall tourist experience is monotonous and does not include activities or services that might encourage guests to stay longer. Visitors are typically transported by electric vehicles from the entrance to the temple complex, where they explore the site on foot. The journey usually lasts less than an hour, leaving little to stimulate further exploration or encourage tourists to spend more time or money in the area.</p>
<p>Despite the rising number of visitors, the local community has not seen significant benefits from the influx of tourists. The site remains a &#8220;stopover&#8221; rather than a fully developed destination. The surrounding community has not been effectively integrated into the tourism ecosystem, meaning that many local residents do not benefit from tourism-related services. There are very few businesses offering the kinds of services that could enhance a tourist&#8217;s visit, such as shopping or cultural experiences. As a result, tourists often return to nearby cities like Hội An or Da Nang, where the tourism infrastructure is more developed.</p>
<p>There have been some initiatives to address this issue, such as the establishment of a community tourism village in 2013, which was supported by the International Labour Organization (ILO). The village was intended to offer accommodation and other services, managed by local families. However, this project has largely failed, with low occupancy rates and many of the lodgings remaining closed. The residents, who were initially encouraged to shift from farming to tourism-related activities, still struggle to benefit economically from their proximity to the sanctuary.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is only one hotel near the sanctuary, which has struggled to attract guests despite significant investment. This lack of services around the sanctuary, such as cultural attractions, local products, and diverse dining options, has limited the potential for tourism to create a sustainable economic benefit for the surrounding community.</p>
<p>In contrast to other heritage sites like Hội An, which have successfully created a thriving tourism ecosystem that benefits local businesses and provides a wide range of services for visitors, Mỹ Sơn remains underdeveloped in terms of tourist infrastructure. While it continues to attract significant numbers of visitors, without more comprehensive development and the creation of a broader tourism ecosystem, Mỹ Sơn is unlikely to reach its full potential as a key tourism destination.</p>
